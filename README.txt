The game is developed using the Phaser engine (sourced from CDN). I haven't set up a remote server for the game, so please use the Live Server extension for VS Code or another local server to load the game.

The game's main menu contains two buttons: Play Game and About. When players click on About, they will watch an ending animation about the developer's information and then return to the main menu. By clicking Play Game, players first need to enter their username (which will subsequently be displayed in the game). After that, they can choose a map; there are two maps available. Upon death, players will automatically respawn on the current map. In the top right corner of the game screen, there's a white return button; players can click this button to return to the main menu.
